<li><b>Javascript Events</b></li>
<ul>
<li>What’re Events? - These are actions that are triggered either by mouse click, function calls, keyboard strokes, etc.</li>
<li>Describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on media</li>
<li>Functions: Remains a block of text unless it’s called by an event handler.</li>
<li>Event Handlers: You can respond to an event on your page using these.</li>
<li>Popup Boxes: Windows that pop out of the screen, useful in warning the user, gathering input, or verification.</li>
<li><a href="lesson1.html">browser sample</a></li>
</ul><br>

<li><b>Conditions, Controls, and Loops</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Conditional Statements: perform different actions for different decisions.
If Else If Statement: refers to an if statement depending on another if statement.</li>
<li>If Statement: used to check or verify a condition & is executed ONLY if the condition is true <br>(Should be referred as a statement, not a function.)
This construct evaluates a condition to True or False, then runs a specific code depending on the result.</li>
<li>Nested If Statement: If statement w/ another if statement (parent and child); <br>used when “child” condition is only checked when the parent condition is true.</li>
<li>If-Else Statement: similar to if statement, but we are given an alternative instruction when the argument is NOT true.</li>
<li>If Else If Statement: refers to an if statement depending on another if statement.</li>
<li><a href="lesson2.html">browser sample</a></li>
</ul><br>

<li><b>Conditions, Controls, and Loops</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Switch Statement: used when a condition may have multiple results &<br> a different set of operation is done based on each result or input.</li>
<li>Functions: a self-contained piece of code that performs a particular “function” when  called.</li>
<li>Argument: When functions are defined using “function,” followed by its name and the open & close<br> parentheses; provides additional information needed by the function to process. 
</li>
<li>Return Statement: For when a function requires specifying a resulting output (ex: computation); functions that give out a value must use this</li>
<li><a href="lesson3.html">browser sample</a></li>
</ul><br>

<li><b>Loops</b></li>
<ul>
<li>The for loop is used when you know how many times the block of code must be iterated</li>
<li>The while loop is used if you know when the condition will be met.<br> It will loop through the set of codes until the condition is met.</li>
<li>Do-while loops work like the while loop except that the code will be executed once and is repeated as<br> long as the set condition is true, but will stop once the condition is false.</li>
<li>For-in loop through the elements of an array or an object.</li>
<li>The break statement will stop or break the loop once the specified condition becomes true and<br> then execute the nextcode if any after the loop.</li>
<li>The continue statement will stop or break the loop for a setvalue then continue to<br> loop with the nest value.
</li>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>This quarter's JavaScript lessons were a big step up for me. I learned about events, which make websites interactive by responding to clicks and other actions. I also got the hang of conditional statements and functions, which help control how code runs and make it easier to reuse.<br><br>

At first, it was tough, but with practice, I got better at using these tools in my projects. I can now make web pages that react to what users do and write code that's more organized and efficient.<br><br>

Overall, it was a great learning experience, and I'm excited to keep improving my skills. These lessons have given me a solid foundation for building more complex and engaging web applications in the future.<br><br>
